# MCNP2ACABTools

This is a small collection of modules intended to allow the transfer of Monte Carlo software data to ACAB. Currently, it is focused on MCNP, but the same objects could be generated from other MC software such as PHITS. This allows the user to read cell, material and residual nuclei information and use them to create a ACAB input.

If you use this module and find it useful, or have suggestions, issues, pull requests, etc, feel free to write.
